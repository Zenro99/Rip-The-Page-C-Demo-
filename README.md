Summary: This is basically a game idea about a simple "drawn" stickman who fights hyperrealistic creatures. 

The lore of this game is that there were alien "hypermalgamations", (who look like actual real life objects and monsters) who were fighting in a war with the stickmans. Before there used to be a singular artifact (im still brainstorming this) used to completely change the war against the hypermalgamations, however, it seemed to dissappear after the stickmen won the war and managed to rid alien of hypermalgamations. 

After years of peace, innovation, and technological advancements, the stickmen are living in the modern era. Unfortunately, due to greed and multiple industrious experiments, there was a massive energy signal from their lab, caused by an infinite or perpetual energy machine that was created, that managed to alert even more hypermalgamated races across the galaxy to earth. 

Of course, the aliens come back to earth, and detected the infinite perpetual machine. Due to this, they decide to find the machine and gain it for themselves, because they never found out as a species how to create such a machine. And so, there were multiple, multi-level, high-end planned invasions of most of the capitals of the world, with the stickmen only having to fight with our current technology. 

Now, just a month into this war. It almost seems futile, 78% of the stick race has either been enslaved, killed, or tortured for the location of the machine. Of which, the stickmen have hidden, and could not be used due to it being too unstable, but they have deduced that the aliens might also be looking for it as well. 

Zen is the main character of this game, who would be the revealed as the son of one of the lead scientists of the P-ENERGY, (perpetual energy) project. He gets seperated with his father during the opening scene explosion and tries desperately to reunite with him over the course of the game. 

Currently, due to experience and knowledge limitations, i've decided to create a demo on C++ as a sort of side project along with school.
